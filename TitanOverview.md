Titan is a service-oriented framework that interconnects sensor nodes worn on the body, integrated into tools, and located in the environment with mobile phones, notebooks, and backend servers.

# Motivation #

The idea is to provide a pervasive computing environment that you can carry with you. The code for sensor network nodes is based on TinyOS, the network and application management in Java.
