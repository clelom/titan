     * TODO: it would be a damn good idea to implement the DataPacket in a clean manner, with a getShortArray and a getCharArray (and
     * appopriate setters) to have an abstraction on exactly that problem.
     * As far as I know, this problems comes because some hardware (the tMoteSky for example) can only communicate with char-values, while
     * on the laptop, shorts are okay.
     *
     * TODO: there is also a little problem, when communicating between two virtual nodes... some data does not get sent (via TCP) which need further investigating
     *
     * TODO: the DataPacket has setter and getter for timestamp... but this timestamp is not sent over TCP... you can only use timestamps
     * when the whole DataPacket stays on the same virtual node all time.
     * and don't forget to set the timestamp again, if you send out a new packet, if they're needed later (for exmample, for the TitanFileWriter)
