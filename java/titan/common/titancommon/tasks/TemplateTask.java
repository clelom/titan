 * TODO for a new task:
 *  1) find a free task ID in "int[] testtasks" in titancommon/services/ServiceDirectory.java
 *  2) make an entry of this task in "private static final Class[] execTaskClasses" in titancommon/node/TitanTask.java
 *  3) make an entry of this task in "public ConfigReader( String strFilename ) throws FileNotFoundException" in titan(titanmobile)/ConfigReader.java
 *  4) implement all methods here
 *  5) create a ETemplateTask in titancommon/node/tasks and continue there with the implementation
 *
 * you'll need to change the class name of this task according to your task name
 * don't forget that the filename and the class name must match!
